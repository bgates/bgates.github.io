These days I work as a software developer. I had a little bit of college coursework in software development: one semester of FORTRAN about which I remember zippo, a couple weeks with C and PHP, and a semester of bioinformatics during which knowledge of Perl was assumed (meaning, we had to use Perl to do the homework, but I don't remember it as part of the curriculum for the course). Other than that, I'm self-taught, which means I spend a lot of time reading stuff on the internet and wondering how to apply what I read to my own purposes. There are times, while I'm reading tutorials and codebases, that I feel much like I used to when I looked at the pristine, finished, perfect, explanation-free solutions in the back of the book.

This blog is also for me, because one of the most important things I learned while teaching is the value of refining my own thoughts until they are clear enough to put into words.
